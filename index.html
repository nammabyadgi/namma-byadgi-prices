          </div>
          <p class="note">
            AC lots usually have **better shelf-life** and consistency across bags; they are preferred by spice brands that want stable color rather than very high brightness.

          </div>
          <p class="note">
            Moisture lots give a **brighter colour** and stronger aroma after processing, but need expert drying and cleaning before grinding to avoid spoilage.
